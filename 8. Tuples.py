#Tuples are immutable
#Tuples use () instead of [] in lists
numbers=(0,4,5,90,7)
#To print element using index, use
print(numbers[1])
#A list of tuples
coordinates= [(0,9),(4,5),(9,8)]
print(coordinates)

#Comma is actually the operator that creates the tuple, not (). () is just for grouping
